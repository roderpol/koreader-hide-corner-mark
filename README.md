This is a patch for KoReader that hides the status corner marks (dogears) that display on the bottom right corners of book covers in Mosaic View.
Add the patch to the koreader/patches folder and that's it, it will be enabled by default when KoReader is opened.
If you want to disable it, a toggle is added in Cabinet Menu - Settings - Mosaic and detailed list settings - Hide status corner mark
